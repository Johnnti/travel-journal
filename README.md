# How To Run The Program

This guide will walk you through the steps to run this React Vite application on your local computer.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have the following installed on your system:

* **Node.js:** You can download and install Node.js from the official website: [https://nodejs.org/](https://nodejs.org/) (It's recommended to install the LTS version). Node.js comes with npm (Node Package Manager).
* **npm** (or **yarn** or **pnpm**): While npm is included with Node.js, you can also use yarn ([https://yarnpkg.com/](https://yarnpkg.com/)) or pnpm ([https://pnpm.io/](https://pnpm.io/)). The commands in this guide will primarily use `npm`, but you can easily adapt them for yarn (`yarn`) or pnpm (`pnpm`).

## Installation and Running

Follow these steps to get the application running:

1.  **Clone the GitHub Repository:**

    Open your terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory where you want to clone the project. Then, use the following command, replacing `<your_github_username>` and `<your_repository_name>` with your actual GitHub username and repository name:

    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/](https://github.com/)<your_github_username>/<your_repository_name>.git
    ```

    For example, if your username is `octocat` and your repository name is `my-react-app`, the command would be:

    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/octocat/my-react-app.git](https://www.google.com/search?q=https://github.com/octocat/my-react-app.git)
    ```

2.  **Navigate to the Project Directory:**

    Once the repository is cloned, navigate into the project's root directory using your terminal:

    ```bash
    cd <your_repository_name>
    ```

    Replace `<your_repository_name>` with the name of your repository.

3.  **Install Dependencies:**

    The application relies on various external libraries (dependencies). You need to install these using npm (or yarn/pnpm). In your project directory, run:

    **Using npm:**

    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

    **Using yarn:**

    ```bash
    yarn install
    ```

    **Using pnpm:**

    ```bash
    pnpm install
    ```

    This command will read the `package.json` file in your project and download all the necessary packages into a `node_modules` folder.

4.  **Start the Development Server:**

    Vite provides a development server that allows you to view and test your application in your browser. To start the server, run the following command in your project directory:

    **Using npm:**

    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```

    **Using yarn:**

    ```bash
    yarn dev
    ```

    **Using pnpm:**

    ```bash
    pnpm dev
    ```

    This command will typically start the development server on a specific port (usually `http://localhost:5173/` or a similar address). The exact address will be displayed in your terminal output.

5.  **Open Your Browser:**

    Once the development server has started, open your web browser and navigate to the address provided in the terminal (e.g., `http://localhost:5173/`). You should now see your React Vite application running!

## Important Notes

* **Keeping the Server Running:** The development server will continue to run in your terminal until you manually stop it. You can usually stop it by pressing `Ctrl + C` in the terminal.
* **Automatic Updates:** Vite's development server supports Hot Module Replacement (HMR), which means that when you make changes to your code, the browser will automatically update without a full page reload, preserving the application's state.
* **Building for Production:** When you are ready to deploy your application, you will need to build a production-ready version. You can do this by running:
    * **npm:** `npm run build`
    * **yarn:** `yarn build`
    * **pnpm:** `pnpm build`
    This will create a `dist` folder in your project containing the optimized build output.

## Further Assistance

If you encounter any issues or have questions, please refer to the project's documentation or reach out to the development team.

Happy coding!
